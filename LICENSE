DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS OF LIABILITY
Limited Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, the Software is provided "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION IS WITH THE LICENSEE.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall Licensor be liable to Licensee for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this Agreement or out of the use or inability to use the Software (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if the Licensee has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Each party acknowledges that the limitation of liability set forth in this section reflects the allocation of risk between the parties and the economic balance under this Agreement. In no event shall Licensor be liable to Licensee for damages resulting from the combination of the Software, in whole or in part, with any other applications.
Essential Basis of Agreement.

INDEMNIFICATION
Licensee agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and, at Licensor's option, defend Licensor, its officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any losses, liabilities, costs (including reasonable attorney's fees) or damages resulting from any claim by any third party arising from a breach by Licensee of its obligations under this Agreement, provided that in any case Licensee shall not settle any third-party claim against Licensor unless such settlement completely and forever releases Licensor with respect thereto or unless Licensor provides its prior written consent to such settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any case for which Licensee provides defense of a third-party claim against Licensor, at Licensor 's option as contemplated above, Licensor shall nonetheless have the right to participate in such defense by counsel of its choice at its own expense.

In addition, Licensor may, at its expense, audit the number of copies of the Software in use by Licensee and the equipment on which the Software is installed at any time during the term. Any such audit shall be conducted during regular business hours at Licensee’s facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee’s business activities. Shall the audit reveal use of the Software out of the scope of this Agreement, the Licensor shall be entitled to terminate the agreement and the Licensee shall bear the cost of the audit.

GENERAL
Entire Agreement. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and merges all prior oral and written agreements, discussions and understandings between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. The preprinted terms and conditions contained on Licensee's purchase order and Licensor's order acknowledgement form and reference to terms and conditions contained on either document shall be inapplicable to any order placed by Licensee under this Agreement, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties.
Independent Contractors. In entering and performing this Agreement, the parties are independent contractors.

Amendments; Modifications. This Agreement may not be amended or modified except in a writing duly executed by authorized representatives of both parties.
Assignment; Delegation. Licensee may not assign any of its rights or delegate any of its duties under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Licensor. Any attempted assignment or delegation hereunder without such prior written consent shall be null, void and of no effect.
Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable for any reason in any jurisdiction, such provision shall be construed to have been adjusted to the minimum extent necessary to cure such invalidity or unenforceability. The invalidity or unenforceability of one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall not have the effect of rendering any such provision' invalid or unenforceable in any other case, circumstance or jurisdiction, or of rendering any other provisions of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable whatsoever.
Waiver. No waiver under this Agreement shall be valid or binding unless set forth in writing and duly executed by the party against whom enforcement of such waiver is sought. Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the specific matter described therein and shall in no way impair the rights of the party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other time. Any delay or forbearance by either party in exercising any right hereunder shall not be deemed a waiver of that right. The parties agree to expressly exclude the application of articles 1222 and 1223 of the French Civil Code.

GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION
This Agreement constitutes the legal document governing the rights of the parties, and all legal disputes concerning the Agreement shall be resolved and construed in compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the laws of France unless an applicable national statute contains invariable rules, which specifically overrule any terms of this Agreement.
